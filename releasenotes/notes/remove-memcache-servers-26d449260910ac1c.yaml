upgrade:
  - |
    The deprecated parameter keystone::memcache_servers is now removed and the
    automatic behavior to set cache_enabled and cache_backend has been removed.
    You must now set the cache_memcached_servers and explicitly set cache_enabled
    to true and cache_backend to the backend you want to use for caching.
