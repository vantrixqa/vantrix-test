upgrade:
  - |
    All references for the Keystone port 35357 in the module has been replaced
    with port 5000, we recommend you update any hardcoded values for port 35357
    to port 5000 because port 35357 will be removed in a future release.
deprecations:
  - |
    Keystone is currently deployed with port 35357 and port 5000 and will continue
    being deployed with both ports however the usage of port 35357 is now deprecated
    and deployment of port 35357 will be removed in a future release.
