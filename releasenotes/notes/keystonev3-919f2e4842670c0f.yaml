deprecations:
  - keystone::endpoint::version is not default to undef which means
    Keystone endpoints will be versionless by default, so it enables
    services to reach Keystone v3 with is the current stable version.
    Therefore, we don't need the version parameter, so we deprecate it
    in this cycle and will remove it later.
    If the user used to set 'unset' to $version, it will keep v2.0 endpoint
    but a migration to undef is recommended.
