  - The flag 'create_domain_entry' was added to the 'keystone::ldap_backend'
    resource. It defaults to false. But, if set to true, it will create the

    that in order for the keystone server to be refreshed, the 'manage_service'
    and 'enabled' flags need to be set in the base ::keystone module.
