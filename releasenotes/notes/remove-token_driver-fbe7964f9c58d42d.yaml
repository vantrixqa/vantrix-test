deprecations:
  - |
    The keystone::token_driver is now deprecated, has no effect and will
    be removed in a future release.
upgrade:
  - |
    The keystone::token_driver parameter which has had no effect that past
    couple of releases and is now deprecated. This parameter if it was set
    to memcache would install the appropriate python-memcache package.
    Now that this is removed you need to ensure keystone::manage_backend_package
    is set properly if you have caching enabled since that manages that package
    now. The default value for manage_backend_package is true so if you don't
    set it explicitly to false there is no change required on your part.
